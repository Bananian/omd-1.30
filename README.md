 OMD - The Open Monitoring Distribution for armhf (ARMv7) 

About OMD
--------------
OMD implements a completely new concept of how to install, maintain and
update a monitoring system built on Nagios.

OMD bundles Nagios together with many important addons and can easily be
installed.

About this armhf Port
--------------
This package is based on the vanilla sources for the official releases
which can be downloaded at http://files.omdistro.org/releases/sources/

It requires at least an ARMv7 CPU and will not run on the Raspberry Pi
(which is ARMv6).
Banana Pi and many, many other ARM SoC boards will work fine.
